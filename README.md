# Graffiti Wall

A collaborative graffiti experience for events. Display the wall on a large screen and let visitors join from their phones by scanning the QR code. Every spray action appears live on the video wall.

## Features

- ðŸ“º **Video wall view** â€“ Hosts run `/` to show the shared canvas and QR code.
- ðŸ“± **Join flow** â€“ Guests enter their name, email, and agree to the guidelines before painting.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Spray controls** â€“ Five preset colors and an adjustable spray radius feel like a can of paint.
- ðŸ”„ **Real-time sync** â€“ Built with Socket.IO so every mark is broadcast instantly to every connected screen.
- ðŸ§¹ **Host clear** â€“ Trigger a full reset of the wall from the painter page when needed.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the collaboration server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open the wall view (defaults to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/)) on the main display.
4. Ask guests to scan the QR code or visit [`http://localhost:3000/join`](http://localhost:3000/join) on their devices.

## Development tips

- Use `npm run dev` for automatic restarts when editing the server.
- Sprays are stored in memory only. Restarting the server clears the canvas for everyone.
- The wall automatically adapts to the browser window size; resize the window after connecting if you change the display resolution.
